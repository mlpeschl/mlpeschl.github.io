Which songs do you like to play on the piano?\n Mostly classical/romantic music, but I would love to learn jazz in the future. Some of my current most liked pieces:  Ravel - Sonatine, No. 2, \u0026ldquo;Mouvement de Menuet\u0026rdquo; (First movement is great too, never played the third one.) Debussy: Suite Bergamasque - II. Menuet Various pieces in Bach\u0026rsquo;s Well Tempered Clavier, particularly the prelude and fugue in C-sharp major, BWV 848  Beethoven: Sonata No.6 in F Major, Op.10 No.2 Schumann\u0026rsquo;s Papillons      What\u0026rsquo;s the most beautiful theorem?\n If I really have to choose, I would say I am a big fan of the dominated convergence theorem. It\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to understand with undergraduate measure theory and opens a vast and versatile area of applications. On one day you use it to find the limit of an infinite series and on another day you use it to prove completeness of a metric space. Quite beautiful if you ask me.
