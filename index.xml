&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of reinforcement learning, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) form a mathematical model for the underlying decision process of an agent that is unable to know the exact state it is currently in. While incorporating uncertainty about the state of the environment complicates matters mathematically, it allows for modeling more general problems that arise in various real world problems. Take, for example, a robot which has to navigate through its environment by using sensor data. Such data is inevitably noisy, which gives rise to an inherent uncertainty about the exact state that the robot is currently in.
Even in discrete environments, like Atari games (which have become a standard task in deep reinforcement learning research), a single frame sometimes fails to convey the exact state of the environment, since variables depending on the rate of change (e.g. velocity of an enemy) can only be inferred through multiple consecutive observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post we will explore a popular method for tracking the unobservable state in a POMDP, called particle filtering, with a simple example of recovering noisy observations in a discrete time Markov process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pomdps-and-beliefs&#34;&gt;POMDPs and Beliefs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally, a POMDP consists of a tuple $\langle S, A, \Omega, T, O, R \rangle$, where $S$ is the state space, $A$ is the set of actions and $\Omega$ denotes the set of possible observations. A transition function $T(s&#39;|s,a)$ gives the probability of transitioning to state $s&#39;$ when in state $s \in S$ and executing action $a \in A$, whereas an observation function $O(o | s&#39;,a)$ gives the probability of observing observation $o \in \Omega$ after action $a$ has taken the agent to state $s&#39;$. Finally, $R(s,a)$ gives the reward when taking action $a$ in state $s$. The goal (as in the fully observable Markov decision process), is usually to maximize an expected long-term reward of the form
$$\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^h \gamma^t R_t\right],$$
where $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ is a discount factor, $h$ is the planning horizon and $R_t$ is the reward obtained at timestep $t$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle the problem of partial observability, one needs to incorporate some kind of memory into the agents decision process. While tracking a history of past events is one possibility, another approach is to summarize this into a sufficient statistic, called the belief state $b(s)$. The belief state is a probability distribution over all possible states and models the agents believes about the current true state of the environment. Although the exact computation of $b$ with respect to an initial prior belief $b_0$ when observing $o$ after action $a$ is possible through Bayesian updating, this requires knowledge of the POMDP dynamics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}b_{a,o}(s&#39;) = \frac{O(o|s&#39;,a)\sum_{s\in S} T(s&#39;|s,a)b(s)}{\sum_{s&#39; \in S}O(o|s&#39;,a)\sum_{s\in S}T(s&#39;|s,a)b(s)}.\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the model is known, updating can turn out to be cumbersome due to computational complexity that quadratically grows with the size of the state space $|S|$. While there are various ways to work around this issue, the theory of particle filtering turns out to be  effective and compatible with the POMDP framework for tracking belief states in an approximate manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;particle-filtering-with-sequential-importance-sampling&#34;&gt;Particle Filtering with Sequential Importance Sampling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particle filtering, also known as Sequential Monte Carlo, is a widely used technique for estimating a noisy and/or unobserved signal in a dynamical system. To be precise, we assume that we have a discrete time Markov process ${X_t}$ ($t \in \mathbb{N}$) governed by dynamics $p(x_t | x_{t-1})$  with initial state distribution $p(x_0)$ (for simplicity, we for now drop the possibility of taking actions in the following example). Furthermore, we assume a model for the observations $Y_t$, which is given by $p(y_t | x_t)$, where the values of $Y_t$ are conditionally independent given the values of $X_t$. The general goal of particle filtering is to then approximate the posterior distribution $p(x_t | y_0, y_1, \dots, y_t)$, i.e. to obtain a probability distribution for the true signal at time $t$, given all the information (observations) up to time $t$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this problem has been studied in various fields for a long time and the mathematical theory behind its possible solutions are rich, we will focus on a simple, but effective Monte Carlo algorithm based on importance sampling. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume we are given a noisy observation $(y_0, y_1, \dots, y_{T-1})$ of the signal $(x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{T-1})$ with length $T$. To recover the signal, consider the following procedure (assuming knowledge of $p(x_t | x_{t-1})$ and $p(y_t | x_t)$ ):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialize $N$ sequences $x_i^n$ $(i = 0, \dots , T-1)$ with initial values $x_0^n$ drawn according to $p(x_0)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialize an array of weights $\mathbf{w_0} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ with ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $t = {1,\dots, T-1}$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict the next value for each sequence by sampling from the model:
$$x_t^i \sim p(x| x_{t-1}^i)$$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each sequence $x_i^n$ ($i \leq t$), evaluate how likely the observation $y_t$ would have been, assuming that $x_i^n$ was the true signal:
$$w_t^n := w_{t-1}^n \cdot p(y_t | x_{t-1}^n)$$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normalize the weights:
$$w_t^n = \frac{w_t^n}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^n}$$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By following this simple algorithm, we obtain $N$ sequences (also called &lt;em&gt;particles&lt;/em&gt;) $x_{0:T-1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^{T}$ with corresponding likelihoods $w_{T-1}^n$ that indicate, how likely it was for sequence $x_{0:T-1}^n$ to be the true sequence that led to the observation vector $(y_0, y_1, \dots, y_{T-1})$. Intuitively, if $N$ is chosen large enough, we would expect to find a sequence $x_{0:T-1}^n$ with a high enough weight $w^n$, such that it is a good candidate solution $x_{0:T-1}^n \approx (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{T-1})$. However, there is a small technical issue with the algorithm above, called &lt;em&gt;particle degeneracy&lt;/em&gt;. Due to randomness, most of the particles $x_{0:t}^n$ will receive a very low weight $w_t^n$ for growing $t$, since propagation of deviations in the generation of $x_t^n$ from the true signal can grow arbitrarily large. Therefore, it can happen that almost all weights will be close to $0$ after the normalization step, while one weight of a particle that most closely resembles the true signal will get all the credit. To avoid this, we can completely resample $N$ particles from the sequences $x_{0:t}^n$ from time to time according to their weights $w_t^n$ and reset the weights $w_t^n = \frac{1}{N}$. Over time, this will discard highly unlikely sequences and only keep promising ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see this algorithm in action, consider the following example: Let $X_t | X_{t-1} = x_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1} +1, 16)$ be a discrete time random walk with constant upwards drift. Furthermore, let $Y_t | X_t = x_t \sim \Gamma(8,\sqrt{|x_t|})$ follow a Gamma distribution with constant shape parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start off our simulation experiment by generating a sequence $(x_0, \dots, x_{49})$ of length $T = 50$ and sample an observation signal $(y_0, \dots, y_{49})$ accordingly. Then, we run the algorithm above with particle resampling using a total of $N = 2000$ particles. Figure 1 shows the resulting posterior mean as well as a level 0.99 confidence band obtained from the empirical particle distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Simulation Study&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;SIS_example.png&#34; alt=&#34;space-1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the high noise in the observation, our simple algorithm manages to recover the true signal reasonably well in the mean. Additionally, since we approximate a complete posterior distribution we can make use of the uncertainty quantification that comes with it. This can be particularly useful in reinforcement learning, since the study of decision making inherently involves quantifying ones certainty in particular events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;applications-to-pomdps&#34;&gt;Applications to POMDPs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the example above we excluded the possibility of taking actions in the Markov process $X_t$, particle filtering can be easily extended to the POMDP setting. In fact, sequential importance sampling is a useful tool for approximating the belief state $b(s)$, which in itself can be interpreted as the posterior distribution of the true state given past observations (including actions). For instance, if we had the POMDP dynamics available, we could apply the above algorithm in a slightly modified way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of sampling $x_t^i \sim p(x| x_{t-1}^i)$ we predict a next candidate state given action $a$ and current candidate state $s$:
$$s&#39; \sim T(\cdot | s,a)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking action $a$ and observing $o$, we then update our weights $w$ according to the observation likelihood given $a$ and $s&#39;$:
$$w&#39; = O(o| s&#39;, a)w$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, we could effectively keep track of likely state sequences $(s_0, s_1, \dots,)$ without ever needing to explicitly observe them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to keep in mind that the sequential importance sampling algorithm in the form it is presented above requires explicit knowledge of the state transition and observation model. In case these are available, particle filtering is a useful tool for approximating the exact posterior update $b_{a,o}(s&#39;)$. For example, in Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning, an extension of Monte-Carlo Tree Search for POMDPs [1], particle filtering is used to track the belief state while unrolling episodes through a generative model of the POMDP dynamics. When a model is not available, recent deep learning based approaches have been proposed, like deep variational reniforcement learning for POMDPs [2], which learns a deep generative model of the POMDP transition dynamics by sampling likely candidate state sequences through particle filtering. Similarly, particle filters have been used for keeping belief states in Bayesian reinforcement learning for large POMDPs which represent a distribution over possible POMDP models [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. In Parts 2 and 3 of this series, we will dive into more detail of applying particle filtering to POMDP control problems by using methods like the Bayes-Adaptive and deep variational frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remark&#34;&gt;Remark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog has been submitted to &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducedpapers.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; https://reproducedpapers.org&lt;/a&gt;, which features a collection of reproducibility attempts of papers in the field of Deep Learning by various people. If you are interested, feel free to check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;imagepriortitle.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Image_Prior&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Deep Image Prior&lt;/a&gt; is a convolutional neural network (CNN), designed to solve
various inverse problems in computer vision, such as denoising, inpainting and super-resolution. Unlike other CNNs designed for these kinds of tasks, the Deep Image Prior does not need any training data, besides the corrupted input image itself. Generally speaking, the network is trained to reconstruct the corrupted image from noise. However, since the architecture of the Deep Image Prior fits structured (natural) data a lot faster than random noise, one can observe that in many applications recovering the noiseless image can be done by stopping the training process after a predefined number of iterations. The authors of the paper (&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10925&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ulyanov et al.&lt;/a&gt;) explain this as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;] although in the limit the parametrization can fit un-
structured noise, it does so very reluctantly. In other words,
the parametrization offers high impedance to noise and low
impedance to signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page features an independent reproduction of some of the results published in the original paper, without making use of the already available open-source code. We will describe the design steps that were necessary to get the architecture running and we will explain which ambiguities had to be resolved when interpreting the text material provided by the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-network-architecture&#34;&gt;The Network Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network architecture consists of several convolutional downsampling blocks followed by convolutional upsampling blocks. Furthermore, after each downsampling block a skip connection is added, which links to a corresponding upsampling layer. For a small visualization, see the figure below (taken from the authors &lt;a href=&#34;https://box.skoltech.ru/index.php/s/ib52BOoV58ztuPM#pdfviewer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Supplementary Materials&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;img src=&#34;Data/Visualization/architecture.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reimplemented this in Python 3, making use of the PyTorch framework. To do so, we separately defined one Module Class for each of these blocks. For the full source-code, you can download and experiment with the Jupyter Notebooks attached in the Notebooks directory of this Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the downsampling blocks work as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Model_Down(nn.Module):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    Convolutional (Downsampling) Blocks.

    nd = Number of Filters
    kd = Kernel size

    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    def __init__(self,in_channels, nd = 128, kd = 3, padding = 1, stride = 2):
        super(Model_Down,self).__init__()
        self.padder = nn.ReflectionPad2d(padding)
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels = in_channels, out_channels = nd, kernel_size = kd, stride = stride)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(nd)

        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels = nd, out_channels = nd, kernel_size = kd, stride = 1)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(nd)

        self.relu = nn.LeakyReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.padder(x)
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.padder(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.bn2(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, based on the papers default architecture, we default set the number of filters to 128 with a kernel size of 3. We incorporated the downsampling in the convolutional layer with by using the implemented strides of 2. This is also what the authors describe in the supplementary materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we defined the upsampling blocks work as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Model_Up(nn.Module):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    Convolutional (Upsampling) Blocks.

    nu = Number of Filters
    ku = Kernel size

    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    def __init__(self, in_channels = 132, nu = 128, ku = 3):
        super(Model_Up, self).__init__()
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(in_channels)
        self.padder = nn.ReflectionPad2d(1)
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels = in_channels, out_channels = nu, kernel_size = ku, stride = 1, padding = 0)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(nu)

        self.conv2 =  nn.Conv2d(in_channels = nu, out_channels = nu, kernel_size = 1, stride = 1, padding = 0)
        self.bn3 = nn.BatchNorm2d(nu)

        self.relu = nn.LeakyReLU()

    def forward(self,x):
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = self.padder(x)
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.bn2(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.bn3(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = F.interpolate(x, scale_factor = 2, mode = &#39;bicubic&#39;)
        return x

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The input channels have to match the number of output channels from the last upsampling block plus the number of output channels of the skip connections (since we concatenate the skip connections with the upsampling blocks, for an explanation see the ambiguity section). In the default architecture, this will always be 132, but can of course be manually defined differently, when needed. Initially, we implemented the upsampling blocks using the bilinear upsampling. Nevertheless, we realized that for a high number of iterations (around 8000) the network sturcture performs better with bicubic upsampling.
The upscaling factor of 2 is chosen to match the stride 2 downsampling. This way, we obtain an output image of the same width and height as the input noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we defined the skip blocks in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Model_Skip(nn.Module):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    Skip Connections
    ns = Number of filters
    ks = Kernel size
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    def __init__(self,in_channels = 128 ,stride = 1 , ns = 4, ks = 1, padding = 0):
        super(Model_Skip, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels = in_channels, out_channels = ns, kernel_size = ks, stride = stride, padding = padding)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(ns)
        self.relu = nn.LeakyReLU()

    def forward(self,x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the final network can be easily defined, by concatenating the modular building blocks together in the same way as described in the figure above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, length = 5, in_channels = 32, nu = [128,128,128,128,128] , nd =
                    [128,128,128,128,128], ns = [4,4,4,4,4], ku = [3,3,3,3,3], kd = [3,3,3,3,3], ks = [1,1,1,1,1]):
        super(Model,self).__init__()
        assert length == len(nu), &#39;Hyperparameters do not match network depth.&#39;

        self.length = length

        self.downs = nn.ModuleList([Model_Down(in_channels = nd[i-1], nd = nd[i], kd = kd[i]) if i != 0 else
                                        Model_Down(in_channels = in_channels, nd = nd[i], kd = kd[i]) for i in range(self.length)])

        self.skips = nn.ModuleList([Model_Skip(in_channels = nd[i], ns = ns[i], ks = ks[i]) for i in range(self.length)])

        self.ups = nn.ModuleList([Model_Up(in_channels = ns[i]+nu[i+1], nu = nu[i], ku = ku[i]) if i != self.length-1 else
                                        Model_Up(in_channels = ns[i], nu = nu[i], ku = ku[i]) for i in range(self.length-1,-1,-1)]) #Elements ordered backwards

        self.conv_out = nn.Conv2d(nu[0],3,1,padding = 0)
        self.sigm = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self,x):
        s = [] #Skip Activations

        #Downpass
        for i in range(self.length):
            x = self.downs[i].forward(x)
            s.append(self.skips[i].forward(x))

        #Uppass
        for i in range(self.length):
            if (i == 0):
                x = self.ups[i].forward(s[-1])
            else:
                x = self.ups[i].forward(torch.cat([x,s[self.length-1-i]],axis = 1))

        x = self.sigm(self.conv_out(x)) #Squash to RGB ([0,1]) format
        return x

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preprocessing-inpainting&#34;&gt;Preprocessing (Inpainting)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to analyze the image correctly and succeed in the inpainting task, we needed to preprocess the original image and the mask. Indeed, our code takes as inputs the original image and the mask that needs to be placed on it. First of all, the images have been converted to numerical arrays and their sizes have been adjusted in such a way that they were compatible. Furthermore, the two numpy arrays have been converted to PyTorch tensors. The masked image will then be given by the normalized multiplication of the torch tensors corresponding to the masked image and the original one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;im = Image.open(&#39;kate.png&#39;)
maskim = Image.open(&#39;kate_mask.png&#39;)
maskim = maskim.convert(&#39;1&#39;)

im_np = np.array(im)
mask_np = np.array(maskim,dtype = float)
mask_np = (np.repeat(mask_np[:,:,np.newaxis], 3, axis = 2)/255)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))
plt.imshow(im_np*mask_np)

mask_tensor = torch.from_numpy(mask_np).permute(2,0,1)
im_tensor = torch.from_numpy(im_np).permute(2,0,1)

im_masked_tensor = ((mask_tensor*im_tensor).unsqueeze(0)/255).cuda()
mask_tensor = mask_tensor.unsqueeze(0).cuda()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preprocessing-restoration&#34;&gt;Preprocessing (Restoration)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preprocessing steps used in the restoration task are very similar to the ones used in the inpainting task. Since the restoration task is to recover an image, where a certain percentage (e.g. 50%) of the original image pixels have been dropped, we simply initialized a sparse array with half of the entries being equal to 0 and used that as our mask in the same way as in the inpainting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;from scipy.sparse import random
mask_np = random(512,512,0.5,dtype = bool).A.astype(float)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;training-the-model&#34;&gt;Training the Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main loop follows the standard Pytorch conventions. The only difference here is that the input to the loss function must be carefully chosen to prevent cheating. We are only allowed to compute the loss on the masked pixels, which ensures that we do not need the original image to begin with. To ensure this, we just multiply the mask with the original image before we pass it to the loss function. The input is, as suggested by the authors, a uniformly generated tensor with mean 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;#Initialize model params
z = (0.1) * torch.rand((1,32,512,512), device = &amp;quot;cuda&amp;quot;)


#Initialize the Model
net = Model() #Using standard architecture, no hyperparams specified
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(),lr = 0.01)

use_gpu = torch.cuda.is_available()

if use_gpu:
    net = net.cuda()


#Main Training Loop
for epoch in range(2000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = net.forward(z)
    loss = F.mse_loss(output*mask_tensor, im_masked_tensor)

    if (epoch % 250 == 0):
      print(&#39;EPOCH: &#39; + str(epoch))
      print(&#39;LOSS: &#39; + str(loss.item()), end =&#39;\n\n&#39;)
      plt.imshow(output.cpu().view(3,512,512).permute(1,2,0).detach().numpy())
      plt.show()

    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    z = z + (1/(30))*torch.randn_like(z) #Regularization

plt.imshow(output.cpu().view(3,512,512).permute(1,2,0).detach().numpy())

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ambiguities&#34;&gt;Ambiguities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we will list some of the things that were not completely specified in the supplementary materials. For these implementation details, we either tested out multiple implementations and then took the best performing one or we simply used the implementation that seemed most reasonable to us. Some of these ambiguities are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the skip-layers connections, we decided to use  concatenative connections. Initially, we considered using the additive skip connections. However, this would not be compatible with their specified hyperparameters, since the number of output channels on the skip connections would not match the number of input channels in the upsampling modules. We nevertheless tried out both versions and came to the conclusion that the flexibility of freely choosing the amount of channels on the skip connections helps with preventing overfitting to the noise. Since this can only be achieved with concatenative skip connections, we chose to stick to them in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The input and its perturbations: The authors mention that they perturb the input at each iteration by small noise. However, this can be achieved in two different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initializing the input tensor before starting training and then in every iteration taking the initial tensor plus additive noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initializing the input tensor before starting training and then in every iteration taking the previous input tensor plus additive noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried both versions, and both of them do work in their own way. However, despite our expectations being the other way round, the first version seems to be regularizing too much, whereas the second version does achieve better looking results, while still preventing overfitting to noise sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upsampling factor and Downsampling strides: It was not completely clear which strides were used in the downsampling process. Obviously, any stride is possible, as long as the dimensions of the image are large enough. However, this does change the performance of the network. Since for their standard architecture with a kernel size of 3 in the downsampling convolutional blocks and a stride of 2 in the first convolutional layer corresponds to exactly halving the image size for a 512x512 input, we went with that. This also makes the implementation a little bit less tedious, since one does not have to explicitly calculate the upscaling factor anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;inpainting-results&#34;&gt;Inpainting Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reconstructed the original inpainting task on an image of Kate (at least that is what the authors called the image file so we&amp;rsquo;ll call her Kate as well). We seem to be getting comparable results, although our architecture seems to benefit from a few more iterations. Furthermore, we also bombarded Kate with large holes to see how much the Deep Image Prior can reconstruct. Obviously this is an almost impossible task, but the network still seems to be able to recover (quite remarkably) some traits of the original image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the PSNR scores of the respective images, we seem to be achieving comparable, and sometimes even higher scores than those mentioned in the paper. However, especially on the Barbara picture, we cannot seem to recover all the details just as well. This might be due to the architecture overfitting to the noise. Stopping the training process earlier than suggested in the paper does help with the picture quality and does not change the PSNR significantly though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32.84&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;alternative-images&#34;&gt;Alternative images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these images, we did not do any hyperparameter tuning. Instead we used the standard architecture to see what we get. Surprisingly, inpainting seems to work quite well on a variety of images, although the output is always a little bit blurrier than the original image. To alleviate this issue, more training iterations help. We did not use more than 6000 iterations for any of these images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Data/Results/Altim1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the inpainting result on the building did not really blow us away. The fine detail of the windows get blurred out significantly, especially in the areas behind the text. Other high resolution images with fine details suffer from the same effect, which could be considered one of the main weak points of the Deep Image Prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deep Image Prior paper seemed to be self-contained enough to make it easy to reproduce from scratch. The supplementary materials provided by the authors list almost all needed hyperparameters, which proved to work for not only their selection of pictures, but also on a wider variety of tasks (at the cost of some performance). We did, however, encounter some ambiguities, which made the reproduction more cumbersome. Furthermore, on some restoration tasks we did sometimes not manage to achieve the same visual quality of images as presented in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, reproducibility wise, we would give the paper an &lt;strong&gt;8.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Please note, that this score is merely subjective and could vary heavily depending on someone&amp;rsquo;s background with the subject matter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What search engine do you use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecosia seems cool but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to go with DuckDuckGo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Favorite Linux distributions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu for ease of use, Arch Linux for customizability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which songs do you like to play on the piano?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mostly classical/romantic music, but I would love to learn jazz in the future. Some of my current most liked pieces:
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Various pieces in Bach&amp;rsquo;s Well Tempered Clavier, particularly the

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the most useful theorem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I really have to choose, I would say I am a big fan of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominated_convergence_theorem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dominated convergence theorem&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to understand with undergraduate measure theory and opens a vast and versatile area of applications. On one day you use it to find the limit of an infinite series and on another day you use it to prove completeness of a metric space. Quite beautiful if you ask me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is your domain mlpeschl.com and not mpeschl.com?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The letter &amp;lsquo;L&amp;rsquo; in there corresponds to my second name (Leopold), but the reason I included it is more due to the fact that &amp;lsquo;ML&amp;rsquo; corresponds to the fascinating discipline of Machine Learning. (Coincidence? 🤔)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
